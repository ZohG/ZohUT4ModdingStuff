# ZohUT4ModdingStuff
Zoh's UT4 modding files

All the stuff I made for UT4, including published mods and unfinished prototypes, some of it might need some plugins like UTEditorPlus to work. 
Much of this I made a long time ago and was my way of learning modding and programming, and I'm glad people got good use out of a lot of it.
